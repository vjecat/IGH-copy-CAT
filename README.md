# Documentation

## Handbook

The PDF documentation is generated via LaTeX and can be build with the
following steps:

```bash
cd documentation
make
```

The PDF is automatically held up-to-date and can be [downloaded from
GitLab](https://gitlab.com/etherlab.org/ethercat/-/jobs/artifacts/stable-1.5/raw/pdf/ethercat_doc.pdf?job=pdf).

## Doxygen

To generate the Doxygen documentation, the following commands can be used.
Therefore, the configure script must have run (see the [install
file](INSTALL.md)).

```bash
git submodule update --init
make doc
```

An up-to-date Doxygen output can be found on
[docs.etherlab.org](https://docs.etherlab.org/ethercat/1.5/doxygen/index.html).

# Requirements

## Software requirements

Configured sources for the Linux 2.6 (or newer) kernel are required to build
the EtherCAT master.

## Hardware requirements

A table of supported hardware can be found at
http://etherlab.org/en/ethercat/hardware.php.

# Building and installing

See the [install file](INSTALL.md).

# Realtime and Tuning

Realtime patches for the Linux kernel are supported, but not required. The
realtime processing has to be done by the calling module (see API
documentation). The EtherCAT master code itself is passive (except for the
idle mode and EoE).

To avoid frame timeouts, deactivating DMA access for hard drives is
recommended (`hdparm -d0 <DEV>`).
